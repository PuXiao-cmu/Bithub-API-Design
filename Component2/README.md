# Component 2: Integration for Third-Party Tools

## Overview

**Component 2** focuses on enabling native integration of code review tools with the platform. This component provides a seamless way for developers to interact with pull requests (PRs) and their associated metadata, files, and comments.

The implementation includes:

- Displaying PR metadata, such as status, description, and associated commits.
- Displaying a list of PRs, filtering them by status, with some notion of pagination.
- Showing a list of changed files and their inline changes.
- Supporting comments (general and inline) with reactions.
- Supporting merging a pending PR or reject a pending PR or a PR causing a merge conflict.
- Providing GraphQL APIs for querying and mutating PR data.

------

## Features

### 1. Pull Request Metadata

When a PR is viewed, its metadata is displayed, including:

- PR description
- Source commit
- Target commit
- PR status (e.g., PENDING, MERGED, REJECTED, or CONFLICT)

### 2. Changed Files and Inline Comments

- PRs include a list of changed files with detailed line-level changes.
- Developers can add inline comments to specific lines in a file.
- Each inline comment supports reactions like üëç (`+1`) and ‚ù§Ô∏è.

### 3. General Comments

- Developers can add general comments to a PR that are not tied to a specific file or line.
- Reactions can also be added to general comments.

### 4. Merge and Reject Pull Requests

- Support for merging a **pending PR**.
- Support for rejecting:
  - A **pending PR**.
  - A PR that is causing a **merge conflict**.

------

## API Design

GraphQL was chosen because it aligns perfectly with the requirements for integrating third-party tools, particularly for a code review system.
